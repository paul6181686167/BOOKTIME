        comment: "Les tests montrent un problème avec la mise à jour des statuts de livres. Lorsqu'un utilisateur modifie le statut d'un livre (par exemple de 'En cours' à 'Terminé'), l'API est correctement appelée et renvoie une réponse positive (le toast 'Livre mis à jour avec succès !' s'affiche), mais l'interface utilisateur ne reflète pas le changement. Le statut affiché dans le modal reste inchangé après la sauvegarde. L'analyse du code montre que la requête PUT vers /api/books/{id} est bien envoyée avec les données correctes, mais après la fermeture et réouverture du modal, le statut n'est pas mis à jour. Ce problème semble être lié à la façon dont l'état local est géré après la mise à jour."

Les résultats sont correctement triés par pertinence, avec les scores prioritaires (100000+) pour les séries. Les captures d'écran montrent que les livres Harry Potter apparaissent en premier dans les résultats de recherche, avec le badge 'Roman' et l'indication 'Très pertinent'. La tolérance orthographique fonctionne également, car les recherches avec des erreurs comme 'herry potter', 'harry poter', 'astérics' et 'one pece' retournent quand même les résultats corrects.

        comment: "Testing confirms that adding a book from Open Library works correctly. When clicking on a book with a '+' badge, a modal opens with book details and an 'Add to my library' button. Clicking this button successfully adds the book to the user's library, and the UI updates to reflect this change. The book is then displayed with a '✓' badge instead of a '+' badge, indicating it's now in the user's library. The search statistics also update correctly to show the increased count of books in the library."

The handleAddFromOpenLibrary function in App.js (lines 539-581) makes a POST request to the /api/openlibrary/import endpoint with the book's Open Library key and category. After a successful import, the function reloads the books and updates the UI to show the book as owned. The BookDetailModal component also has a handleAddFromOpenLibrary function (lines 104-114) that calls the parent component's onAddFromOpenLibrary function when the 'Add to my library' button is clicked."
